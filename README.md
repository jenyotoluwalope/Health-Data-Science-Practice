Clinical Decision Logic:
This project demonstrates the applicaton of Python for public health data analysis. The goal was to build a script that processes patient biometric data (weight, height) to automatically calculate BMI and flag high risk individuals based on clinical thresholds.
Key Features:
Automated Diagnostics: Uses conditional logic to handle mu;tiple patient records simultaneously.
Visualization: Generates a clinical dashboard using Matplotlob to visually identify at-risk patients against a threshold line.
Technologies Used:
Python 3, Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
Why this matters?
Automating risk stratification is a key component of modern digital health. This script represents a foundational step in building larger clinical decision support systems (CDSS).
